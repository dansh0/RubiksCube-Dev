# Rubik's Cube - Working Repo

Working repo for my multi-part Rubik's Cube tutorial series. Each part will have its own "snapshot" repo that can easily be cloned to use the resources available at the time. This repo is where I can develop freely and experiment before making the videos.

### Setup

If you wish to try it out using this repo rather than a tutorial snapshot, you simply need to install node:
